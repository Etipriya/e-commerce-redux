# Redux Store

Redux Store is a website on which you could add on the entities into your basket and then move up to the payment page.

- In Redux Store, you learn how to manage global state using Reactâ€™s Context API.
- The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React.
- This project is a full stack web application using the MERN Stack to create an e-commerce website using React and Redux with Stripe payments.
- User will be able to checkout when there is lost of connection and view their order history out of checkout. Users will also be able to sign up and login in to their account.

## Installation

- The user should clone the repository from GitHub and install dependencies.
- For development or testing purposes, run npm install on both client and server directories to install dependencies. There are two servers for client side and server side, which can be run on their own.
- To run both servers at the same time, open the root directory and run npm start.

## Usage

- This application will allow users to add products to their cart either from the main page or product page.
- Users can then checkout using Stripe and view their order history.
